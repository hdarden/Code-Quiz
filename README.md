# Code-Quiz
For this code quiz I created and array of different questions, options, and answers. At the beginning of the quiz there is a start button that when clicked begins the quiz and starts the timer. Once quiz has begun the user is presented with on equestion at a time along with four multiple choice buttons, each with options to answer the question. Once the user clicks on their answer button for the question, the next quiz question is presented, repeating the questions and answers through the full quiz array. When the user runs either runs out of time or answers all the questions, the user's score is displayed and a input box is presented in order to save their score.
